    two passes in my book. I checked on Google, and all the solutions are equivalent to this. The alternative, a
    k-buffer of the stream, would not be constant space. If you're reading this and have better ideas, let me know!

    encountering a closing one, provided it's of the matching type. Easy enough, BUT! such an algorithm requires lots of
    bookkeeping and it's inherently sequential. My implementation below works in a number of passes that only depends
    on the nesting levels of the braces; memory usage is O(n) for both solutions. Also, string operations are highly
    optimized, making this even faster.
