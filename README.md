# Daily coding problem

These are my solutions to https://dailycodingproblem.com, a great resource to practice coding interviews.

I have copied problem definitions and examples verbatim from the one I received, but they might occasionally differ
from yours when questions have been updated to improve clarity or provide additional tests.
Notes added after examples are comments of mine.

## Problems

Each problem comes with a description, a unit tests' battery and a solution.
