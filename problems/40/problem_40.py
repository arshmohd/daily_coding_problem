def coding_problem_40(numbers):
    """
    Given an array of integers where every integer occurs three times except for one integer, which only occurs once,
    find and return the non-duplicated integer. Do this in O(N) time and O(1) space.
    Examples:

    >>> coding_problem_40([6, 1, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6])
    1
    >>> coding_problem_40([13, 19, 13, 13])
    19

    Note: the code below fails for negative numbers, but you could shift the entire array by the minimum.
    Note2: the implementation below makes it evident that the space complexity is O(log_2(n)) rather than O(1).
    This is always the case, unless a specific integer type or a maximum value are specified (they are not above).
