## [<<](../17) Problem 18 [>>](../19)

Given an array of integers and a number k, where 1 <= k <= length of the array, compute the maximum values of each
sub-array of length k. Do this in O(n) time and O(k) space. You can modify the input array in-place and you do not
need to store the results. You can simply print them out as you compute them.

Example:

    >>> coding_problem_18([10, 5, 2, 7, 8, 7], 3)
    [10, 7, 8, 8]
