def coding_problem_49(arr):
    """
    Given an array of numbers, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of the array.
    For example, given the array [34, -50, 42, 14, -5, 86], the maximum sum would be 137, since we would take elements
    42, 14, -5, and 86. Given the array [-5, -1, -8, -9], the maximum sum would be 0, since we would not take any
    elements. Do this in O(N) time.
    Examples:

    >>> coding_problem_49([34, -50, 42, 14, -5, 86])
    137
    >>> coding_problem_49([-5, -1, -8, -9])
    0

    Note: this is similar to the stock prices example of #47.

    Note2: alas, I was on the free tier and this is the last problem I was sent. It's been fun, enabling and
    informative. Thank you dailycodingproblem.com !
