##Problem 2

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of
the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.
Solve it without using division and in O(n).
Example:

    >>> coding_problem_02([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]
