    Suppose you are given a table of currency exchange rates, represented as a 2D array. Determine whether there is a

    any currency, so that you can end up with some amount greater than A of that currency.
    There are no transaction costs and you can trade fractional quantities.

    array. Any difference between the given currency exchange matrix and the computed one implies the possibility of
    arbitration.

    For example, for five currencies and given the exchange rates from the first to the other 4 [b, c, d, e]:
